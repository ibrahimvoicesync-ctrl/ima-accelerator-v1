/**
 * Phase 64: Owner Analytics RPC wrapper + cache layer (server-only).
 *
 * Calls public.get_owner_analytics (migration 00035 — expanded from Phase 54's
 * 00028) via the admin client and wraps the result in next/cache unstable_cache
 * (60s TTL, tag `owner-analytics` — global, not per-user).
 *
 * Phase 64 changes:
 *  - RPC returns 24 pre-computed slots (6 leaderboards x 4 windows) in one call.
 *  - unstable_cache KEY bumps from ["owner-analytics"] to ["owner-analytics-v2"]
 *    in the SAME atomic commit as migration 00035 so stale V1 shapes never
 *    leak through the cache.
 *  - Cache TAG (`owner-analytics`) is UNCHANGED so every existing
 *    revalidateTag(ownerAnalyticsTag(), "default") call site keeps working.
 *  - NEW invalidation: /api/reports (Plan 05, closes v1.6 audit defer).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: imports createAdminClient + next/cache — server-only. Client
 * components must import types from "@/lib/rpc/owner-analytics-types" instead,
 * never from this file. The `import "server-only"` line at the top will crash
 * the build loudly if a client component drags this module into its bundle.
 *
 * The RPC takes NO parameters. The owner is a single user with platform-wide
 * scope — no p_owner_id, no window, no pagination. All 24 slots per call.
