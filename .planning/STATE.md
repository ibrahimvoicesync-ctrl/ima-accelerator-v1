## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Clean rebuild vs migrate — rebuild chosen; old codebase too tangled with cut features
- [Init]: 6 tables only — users, invites, magic_links, work_sessions, roadmap_progress, daily_reports
- [Init]: Google OAuth only — no password flows; Supabase Auth handles OAuth
- [Init]: proxy.ts (not middleware.ts) — Next.js 16 breaking change; route guard runs here
- [Init]: Roles in users table — never in JWT user_metadata (security: user_metadata is user-editable)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- AI chat iframe URL is not yet known — use placeholder in Phase 5; owner must supply URL before ship
- Invite delivery mechanism for V1 is manual (owner copies link) — if email delivery needed, Resend integration must be scoped
- Owner alert SQL queries (3-day inactive, 7-day no-login, 14-day avg rating) need prototyping in Phase 9
