# IMA Accelerator V1

## What This Is

A student performance and coaching management platform for Abu Lahya's halal influencer marketing mentorship program. Three roles — owner (platform admin), coaches (mentors), and students (aspiring influencer marketing agents) — each with dedicated dashboards to track work sessions, roadmap progress, daily reports, and coaching relationships. Built as a clean rebuild from a more complex previous version, shipped as v1.0 with full accountability loop.

## Core Value

Students can track their daily work, follow the 10-step roadmap from joining the course to closing their first brand deal, and submit daily reports that coaches review — the core accountability loop that drives student progress.

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Tier system (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Special) — gamification is V2+
- Leaderboard and rankings — gamification is V2+
- Player cards and collectibles — gamification is V2+
- Streaks and streak milestones — gamification is V2+
- Focus mode / Pomodoro — simplifying work tracker to basic cycles
- Deals tracking pipeline — V2+ feature
- Influencer tracking pipeline — V2+ feature
- Call scheduling — V2+ feature
- In-app notifications system — V2+ feature
- Email notifications (Resend) — V2+ feature
- Settings pages for any role — no name/niche editing in V1
- PostHog analytics — V2+ feature
- Cron jobs (inactive-check, streak-check) — V2+ feature
- Supavisor/connection pooler setup — PostgREST has built-in connection pooler
- Redis/Upstash cache — evaluate only if Phase 24 load testing proves Next.js cache insufficient

## Context

**Shipped v1.0** on 2026-03-18 with 12,742 LOC TypeScript across 298 files.
Tech stack: Next.js 16 (App Router), Supabase (Auth + Postgres + RLS), Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript strict.
12 phases, 38 plans, 218 commits over 3 days.

**v1.1 Phase 13 complete** (2026-03-27): Schema & config foundation — migration adds session_minutes, drops cycle cap, adds 5 KPI columns. Config exports session duration options, KPI targets, roadmap target_days, and getTodayUTC utility.

**v1.1 Phase 14 complete** (2026-03-27): Flexible work sessions — session_minutes on types/API, breakOptions config, formatHoursMinutes utility, state-machine WorkTracker UI (idle/setup/working/break), duration picker, break countdown, hours-based progress bars, dynamic session list, no cycle cap.

**v1.1 Phase 17 complete** (2026-03-28): Calendar view — CalendarTab with react-day-picker month grid, green/amber activity dots, inline day detail panel. Gap closure fixed UTC/local timezone off-by-one in day selection and replaced server-side month navigation with client-side fetch to /api/calendar endpoint. Replaced Work Sessions + Reports tabs on coach and owner student detail pages.

**v1.1 Phase 18 complete** (2026-03-28): Roadmap date KPIs & completion logging — `getDeadlineStatus()` utility with 5-state discriminated union (none/completed/on-track/due-soon/overdue), UTC-safe date math. Badge chips on student RoadmapStep and shared coach/owner RoadmapTab. Progress bar fixed from /10 to /15.

**v1.1 milestone complete** (2026-03-28): 6 phases (13-18), 16 plans. Flexible work sessions, outreach KPI banner, coach/owner KPI visibility, calendar view, roadmap date KPIs all shipped. Supabase Pro plan active.

**Platform purpose:** Abu Lahya runs an influencer marketing accelerator. Students learn to become influencer marketing agents — finding influencers, signing them, then closing brand deals. The platform tracks their daily work discipline and progress through a structured 10-step roadmap.

**Invite system (v1.0):** Email whitelist model — no registration URL generated. Coach/owner enters email, auth callback auto-registers whitelisted users on Google sign-in. Magic links available as alternative.

**Known pending items:**
- AI chat iframe URL not yet provided by Abu Lahya (infra wired, Coming Soon displayed)
- `types.ts` is hand-crafted placeholder (regenerate when Docker + local Supabase running)
- `POST /api/auth/signout` is dead code (Sidebar uses client SDK signOut directly)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js App Router + Supabase + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript strict
- **Auth**: Google OAuth only, no password flows — Supabase Auth handles OAuth
- **Architecture**: Server components for all reads (async pages, no useEffect), small "use client" components only for interactivity, createAdminClient() for server queries
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with RLS + server-side user ID filtering (defense in depth), 6 tables (users, invites, magic_links, work_sessions, roadmap_progress, daily_reports) + alert_dismissals
- **Styling**: Light theme, blue primary (#2563EB), Inter font, ima-* design tokens, CVA-based UI primitives
- **Validation**: Zod on all API inputs, safeParse pattern
- **Access**: Invite-only registration, role-based route guards via proxy (not middleware)

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Clean rebuild vs. migrate old code | Old codebase too tangled with cut features; rebuild is faster and cleaner | ✓ Good — 3-day build, clean architecture |
| 6 tables only (cut 5 from old schema) | Removed deals, influencers, call_schedule, notifications, leaderboard_snapshots to match V1 scope | ✓ Good — minimal schema, all V1 features supported |
| Google OAuth only | Simplifies auth flow, no password management needed | ✓ Good — single auth path, no security surface area |
| Iframe for AI chat | Abu Lahya has existing chatbot, just embed it | ✓ Good — infra wired, awaiting URL |
| Match old visual style | Continuity for users, proven design patterns in reference-old/ | ✓ Good — ima-* tokens consistent throughout |
| Supabase CLI for local dev | Version-controlled migrations, local Postgres + Auth + Studio | ✓ Good — single migration file covers all V1 |
| Email whitelist model for invites | Avoids broken registration URLs; auth callback auto-registers | ✓ Good — simplified flow, resolved Phase 11 gap |
| proxy.ts not middleware.ts | Next.js 16 breaking change; route guard runs in proxy | ✓ Good — works correctly with App Router |
| Resume shifts started_at forward | Client timer needs no elapsed accumulator; Date.now() - started_at always equals active work time | ✓ Good — simple timer math |
| alert_dismissals with time-windowed keys | Dismissed alerts re-trigger in new window (daily/weekly/monthly) | ✓ Good — prevents stale dismissals masking new issues |

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Performance, Scale & Security

**Goal:** Optimize queries, add caching and pagination, harden the 11 PM write spike, audit security, and validate under realistic 5k-student load.

**Target features:**
- Database indexes + admin client singleton + monitoring baseline
- RPC consolidation + server-side pagination + caching for dashboard queries
- pg_cron nightly pre-aggregation + optimistic UI
- API route-level rate limiting (30 req/min/user)
- Security audit (auth checks, RLS, CSRF, cross-student isolation)
- Infrastructure validation under 5k simulated load

**Milestone gates:**
- HALT after Phase 20 — human confirms load test results before proceeding
- HALT at Phase 23 — security audit requires human review before applying changes

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

*Last updated: 2026-03-30 after Phase 20 complete — query consolidation, badge caching, server-side pagination shipped*
